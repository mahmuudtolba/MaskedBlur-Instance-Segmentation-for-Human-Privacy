# MaskedBlur-Instance-Segmentation-for-Human-Privacy
 employs a state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model for precise instance segmentation. This model accurately identifies and isolates individual instances of human subjects within a given visual scene, effectively creating a detailed mask that delineates human presence.
